automatically updated.

=== BUILDING ===
This  project  requires  CMake  to  be built.  It  also  requires  the
following libraries:

* OpenGL
* Qt (5.*, Core, Gui, OpenGL)
* storm (stormlib by Ladislav Zezula)
* Boost
* Lua (5.1)

Build in the following way. You may customize parameters to cmake. (for windows see next section)
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install

==== WINDOWS ====

* install msvc++
* install cmake
* install boost via https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/ (be sure to use the right version and compiler version. cmake may not support the latest version) to <boost-install>
* install Qt via https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2 to <Qt-install>
* download stormlib from https://github.com/ladislav-zezula/StormLib
 * open CMake GUI
 * configure, generate (save the cache entry CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX path somewhere, set it to a empty folder if not present)
 * open solution with visual studio
 * build ALL_BUILD, then INSTALL
* open CMake GUI
 * set cache entry CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH (path) to <Qt-install>;<stormlib-build>, e.g. C:/Qt/5.6/msvc2015;<Stormlib's CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX path>
 * set cache entry BOOST_ROOT (path) to <boost-install>, e.g. C:/local/boost_1_60_0
 * set cache entry CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (path) to a empty destination, e.g. C:/Users/loerwald/Documents/noggitinstall
 * configure, generate
 * open solution with visual studio
 * build ALL_BUILD

=== DEVELOPMENT ===
Feel   free   to   ask   the   owner  of   the   official   repository
(https://bitbucket.org/berndloerwald/noggit3/)  for  write  access  or
fork and post a pull request.
