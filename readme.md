general goal of this branch
---------------------------

- clean things up
- get alphamap import/export working

How?
----

- do nessary splits e.g. each wow file has to have its own class
- encapsulate as much es possible
- implement a "StateMachine" which holds all states e.g. for rendering
- find some kind of proxy between ui and the rendering/data classes (ideas for that are welcome)

More?
------
- later need some sleep
